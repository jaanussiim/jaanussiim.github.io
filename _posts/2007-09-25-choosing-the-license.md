When I first read the [article][1] about licenses on [Coding Horror][2], I had no idea what was 
really waiting for me.

The idea was simple - I needed to have an option for using the code also in closed source 
commercial projects. At the same time I needed something open enough for others to contribute. 
I must say, that choosing the license was really not fun. And I got an headache :) For me the 
[Apache v2][3] looked good enough. At least it seemed to respond to my requirements.

Of course I got a bit more confused, when I was reading the discussion of using LGPL licensed code 
in Apache code. I found in my framework one piece of code, that was under LGPL. It is MD5 
generation in [midlet-engine][4]. At the 
moment I have really no idea how LGPL is going to mix with Apache license. To my understandings, 
it should be OK :) If you  have other opinions, then, please, let me know.

I really hope, that I do not have to come back to the license again...
