What is or will be JaanusSiim?

My name is Jaanus Siim and this is where I will be showing my ideas and projects. The motivation 
for this project would be some peer pressure - to keep me focused on most essential issues with the 
problems I am facing. I'm hoping to give something useful to others and also learn something new.
My main interests at the moment are Ruby, J2ME and RoR development. I will be releasing everything 
open source. Hoping to get some contributions, new ideas and tips how to improve myself and my code :)
At the moment it will be a part time project, but I am very optimistic about making it some day my 
main work. At least I can achieve some J2ME/Ruby skill points. And maybe get my name out there.

PS! Special thanks to Helen. I'm not sure if I would ever started it without her positive attitude :)
